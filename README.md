# dots
------
This is currently just used to store my dot files, if you're looking for anything interesting look in `i3/scripts/` and `i3/scripts/rofi` for my scripts, there's also my minimal-ish nvim config. My setup is tailored to a workflow with 3 monitors where each row on the numpad has the numbered workspaces for each monitor i.e: 1,2,3 -> monitor1, 4,5,6 -> monitor2, 7,8,9 -> montior3.
